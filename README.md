# Home-Default-Credit-Risk

In this project, we analyze the credit score of applicants and their previous behaviour to estimate the default risk. 
In particular, we will utilize libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scipy etc to visualize data, compute summary statistics, 
and detect patterns among data. 

The csv files for this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data.
